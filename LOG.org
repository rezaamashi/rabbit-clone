* Problems

* Fixed
** updatePost
updatePost command still splits error in typegraphql
*** Solution
[[file:src/resolvers/post.ts::const post = await em.findOne(Post, { id });][await]] is needed before ~em.findOne~
** argon2 - actually import
*Problem is not in the ~argon2~ module*
But it was from the auto import of ~lsp~ that direct to ~User~ entity in ~/src/entities/User~
*** Solution
[[file:src/resolvers/user.ts::import { User } from "../entities/User";][import]] directory needs to redirected to relative directory ~../entities/User~
** redis - in runit
within the ~run~ file that provided by runit-init system ~redis~ is defaulted to look for ~redis.conf~ in ~/etc/redis/~. while the installation placed it in ~/etc/redis.conf~
*** Solution
either
1. Move ~redis.conf~ to (mkdir) ~/etc/redis/~
2. Redirect within ~run~ file to ~/etc/redis.conf~
