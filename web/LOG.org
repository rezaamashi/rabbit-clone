* Notes
04:22:34
05:12:55 - creating forgot password page
05:50:59 - creating relationship between posts to user (many-to-one)

** Rule on Server Side Rendering
#+begin_quote
If you have a query in the page, and it is an important SEO
#+end_quote
1. If the page or the content is needs to be found by google, or you need good SEO of the page.
2. If the data is dynamic

* Problems

** New password on token.tsx
1. less than 2 character error not showed
2. token expired error not showed

*** Probable cause
backend on how the data collected
frontend on how the data is showed


* Fixed

** query caching problem 
~_return~ expecting ~,~

*** Solution
needed ~,~ after previous curly bracket ~}~
could be prevented with prettier formatting

** ~NavBar~ in ~"/"~ not showing username me query

** ~logout~ mutation not deleting cache
